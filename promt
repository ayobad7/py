Task: Implement “Remind” button behavior for (A) the lent tag card in Home and (B) the Single Item view.

Business rules:
- The Remind button is enabled only when time-to-due < 3 days (i.e., dueDate - now < 3*24h).
- On click, route to/send a borrower notification with message based on due status:
  * If 1–2 days left:  "{ownerName} reminds you have {daysLeft} day(s) left to return {itemName}."
  * If due today (0 days left or <= 24h): "{ownerName} reminds you to return {itemName} today."
  * If overdue (> 0 days past): "{ownerName} reminds you to return {itemName}, overdue by {daysOverdue} day(s)."

Implementation constraints:
- Do NOT load the whole repo; modify only the provided components.
- Produce a unified git diff patch.
- Keep types strict (TypeScript), do not change public props.
- Extract a small helper: `buildReminderMessage({ ownerName, itemName, dueDate, now })`.
- Add the same Remind button to Single Item view with identical logic & disabled state.

Inputs available:
- Fields: {list your real fields, e.g., borrowerId, ownerName, itemName, dueDate, itemId}
- Notification method: {e.g., notifyBorrower(borrowerId, { message, itemId })} OR navigate to “/notify?…”.

Edge cases:
- Missing/invalid dueDate: disable button and show tooltip “No due date”.
- Timezone: use `now` from client; treat partial days with ceil/floor as described below.

Output:
- One unified `git diff` patch only, touching the two components and adding the helper in `utils/reminders.ts`.
- Keep output under 600 tokens.
